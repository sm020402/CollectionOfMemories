# My Personal Project: *Collections of Songs*

## What will the application do?
This application will be used to organize groups of songs based on when the user was listening to them most,
or based on a time when that song had prominence. 

Specifically, it will allow users to:
- Create a "memory" based on the song name
- Add memories to collections organized by month
- Remove memories from collections
- View the memories contained in the collections

## Who will use it?
My friends said they would so there's that. 

## Why is this project of interest to you?
Oftentimes I find myself listening to a song and reminiscing about a time in my life when I was listening to that song
a lot, or a specific memory where that song was playing. I used to write these things down to keep track of them but it
seems more convenient to track them in a way like this.

## Phase 4: Task 2

Memory added to Collection.
- Fri Nov 26 14:42:23 PST 2021
Memory added to Collection.
- Fri Nov 26 14:42:24 PST 2021
Collection saved

## Phase 4: Task 3
 - The collection class that I designed looks to be redundant so I'd get rid of that class and just use lists or sets of memories instead.
 - There are a lot of nested classes in the GUI class, I would separate those into their own classes to clean up and better organize the code.

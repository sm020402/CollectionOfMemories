# My Personal Project: *Collections of Songs*

## What will the application do?
This application will be used to organize groups of songs based on when the user was listening to them most,
or based on a time when that song had prominence. 
## Who will use it?

## Why is this project of interest to you?
Oftentimes I find myself listening to a song and reminiscing about a time in my life when I was listening to that song
a lot, or a specific memory where that song was playing. I used to write these things down to keep track of them but it
seems more convenient to track them in a way like this. 

A *bulleted* list:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.

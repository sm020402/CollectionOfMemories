# My Personal Project: *Collections of Songs*

## What will the application do?
This application will be used to organize groups of songs based on when the user was listening to them most,
or based on a time when that song had prominence. 

Specifically, it will allow users to:
- Create a "memory" based on the song name and artist
- Add memories to collections organized by month
- Remove memories from collections
- View the memories contained in the collections

## Who will use it?
My friends said they would so there's that. 

## Why is this project of interest to you?
Oftentimes I find myself listening to a song and reminiscing about a time in my life when I was listening to that song
a lot, or a specific memory where that song was playing. I used to write these things down to keep track of them but it
seems more convenient to track them in a way like this.
